## Why this matters

This timestamped deployment predates any public announcements of `agent.json` from other platforms.  
The file was field-tested as part of a live Shopify integration, with proof-of-concept validation across major LLMs (Claude, Gemini, etc.) during Q3 2025.

IntentQL is a declarative standard for safe AI–web interaction. The `agent.json` file is part of its formal contract protocol.
