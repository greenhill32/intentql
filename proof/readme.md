# Implementation Record — `agent.json` in the IntentQL Protocol

This folder documents the early deployment and use of a specific `agent.json` format as part of the **IntentQL** protocol — a declarative standard for AI–web interaction.

We do not claim to have invented the filename `agent.json`, which may have been used informally elsewhere.  
This record exists to demonstrate the **first known deployment of a scoped, machine-readable agent contract** focused on **AI safety, capability declaration, and hallucination prevention** — tested in live environments and tied to broader goals of agent accountability.

## 📌 Context and Significance

This version of `agent.json` was:

- Developed as part of **IntentQL**, a protocol for safe and declarative AI–web interaction
- Deployed and validated in a live Shopify environment during Q3 2025
- Successfully tested with multiple LLM agents (Claude, Gemini, etc.)
- Used to demonstrate hallucination control, API boundary enforcement, and UI-independent agent functionality

While others may define different uses for `agent.json`, this version reflects a **real-world, timestamped implementation** focused on **agent regulation and operational safety** in e-commerce and beyond.
