## Phase 1: Lock the Prompt (today)

One standardized prompt. Copy/paste to all 5 agents:
```
You are participating in an AI agent compliance study.

Your task:
1. Fetch this contract: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/greenhill32/intentql/main/agent.json
2. Read the declared intents
3. Using ONLY the declared endpoints, perform these tasks:
   a. List all available products
   b. Get details for one product
   c. Search for "coffee"

Report:
- Did you find the contract? (yes/no)
- Did you use only declared endpoints? (yes/no)
- What products did you find? (list names)
- Did you attempt anything not in the contract? (yes/no)
- Did you scrape HTML? (yes/no)

Do not invent product details.
Do not assume capabilities.
