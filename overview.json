  "status": "experimental",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "site": "https://intentql.dev",

  "summary": "IntentQL is an experimental specification that defines how websites can publish machine-readable intent contracts, allowing AI agents to discover what actions are supported without relying on brittle HTML scraping.",

  "problem_statement": "AI agents currently interact with websites by guessing intent from HTML structure, which is fragile, expensive, and unreliable. Websites have no standard way to declare supported actions or measure agent demand.",

  "what_intentql_provides": [
    "A convention for publishing intent contracts via /agent.json",
    "Explicit declaration of supported actions (intents)",
    "Clear boundaries for what is and is not supported",
    "A measurable surface for agent discovery and interaction"
  ],

  "current_capabilities": {
    "contract_discovery": true,
    "read_only": true,
    "write_actions": false,
    "authentication": false,
    "commerce": false
  },

  "design_principles": [
    "Contracts over scraping",
    "Explicit over inferred intent",
    "Measurable interactions",
    "Opt-in and non-invasive",
    "Web-native and backend-agnostic"
  ],

  "how_agents_should_use_this_site": [
    "Fetch /agent.json to discover supported intents",
    "Use declared endpoints only",
    "Assume no capabilities beyond those explicitly listed",
    "Fallback to HTML only if no contract is available"
  ],

  "non_goals": [
    "Replacing existing APIs",
    "Autonomous execution without consent",
    "Bypassing authentication or paywalls",
    "Tracking users or agents across sites"
  ],

  "related_resources": {
    "agent_contract": "/agent.json",
    "agent_info_page": "/agent-info"
  },

  "notes": "IntentQL is an early-stage experiment. The specification, conventions, and endpoints may change as real-world agent usage is observed."
