  "name": "IntentQL",
  "tagline": "Machine-readable contracts for AI agent interactions",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "status": "experimental",
  
  "what": "IntentQL is an open specification that allows websites to declare their capabilities and constraints in a machine-readable format. AI agents read the contract and know what they can and cannot do.",
  
  "why": "AI agents currently interact with websites by scraping HTML and guessing at structure. This breaks when sites redesign. IntentQL provides stable, declared interfaces that survive UI changes.",
  
  "how": [
    "Websites publish an /agent.json file declaring intents, endpoints, and constraints",
    "Agents fetch and read the contract before interacting",
    "Agents call only declared endpoints with declared parameters",
    "Constraints explicitly state what is not supported"
  ],
  
  "key_insight": "Contracts don't enforce compliance — they filter for it. Agents that read contracts respect constraints. Agents that don't reveal themselves as incapable.",
  
  "tested": {
    "agents_tested": 8,
    "discovery_success_rate": "50%",
    "constraint_compliance": "100% of agents that fetched the contract",
    "hallucinations_from_compliant_agents": 0
